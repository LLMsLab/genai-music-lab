"""Utils module.

This module provides utility functions for the genaimusiclab project.

Functions:
----------
- extract_terms_from_dependencies():
    Extracts terms from the Python libraries specified in the
    pyproject.toml file.  Reads the dependencies and dev-dependencies
    from the pyproject.toml file, imports each library, and extracts
    terms (e.g., function names, class names) from them. The extracted
    terms are then saved to a file in the .vscode/dictionaries
    directory.

Notes
-----
- The module suppresses warnings and silently skips libraries that fail
  to import.
- Ensure the pyproject.toml file is correctly formatted and located in
  the expected directory.

def extract_terms_from_dependencies():
    """Extract dependencies.

    Extract terms from the Python libraries specified in the
    pyproject.toml file to produce a custom dictionary for the VS Code
    extension Code Spell Checker.

    This function reads the dependencies and dev-dependencies from the
    pyproject.toml file, imports each library, and extracts terms (e.g.,
    function names, class names) from them.  The extracted terms are
    then saved to a file in the .vscode/dictionaries directory.

    Notes
    -----
    The function suppresses warnings and silently skips libraries that
    fail to import.

    Returns
