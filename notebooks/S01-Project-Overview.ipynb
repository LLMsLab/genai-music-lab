    "# Generating AI-Inspired Piano Compositions Based on Beethoven's Sonatas\n",
    "\n",
    "**Abstract**: This paper outlines a methodology to generate novel piano\n",
    "compositions inspired by Beethoven's sonatas using a fine-tuned large\n",
    "language model.  The approach leverages MIDI files to create a text\n",
    "representation of musical pieces. This representation is then used to\n",
    "train the model. The resultant model can generate new compositions in a\n",
    "text format, which can subsequently be converted back to MIDI for\n",
    "playback.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ludwig van Beethoven composed a total of 32 piano sonatas, a monumental\n",
    "contribution that spans his entire compositional career. These sonatas\n",
    "are considered some of the most important works in the solo piano\n",
    "repertoire, showcasing Beethoven's evolution as a composer and his\n",
    "profound impact on the Romantic era of music. They are often referred to\n",
    "as the \"New Testament\" of piano literature, juxtaposed with Johann\n",
    "Sebastian Bach's \"The Well-Tempered Clavier\" being hailed as the \"Old\n",
    "Testament.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it's suitable for this study**: While Beethoven's style is\n",
    "distinctively different from Bach, his sonatas offer a depth and\n",
    "complexity that make them invaluable for fine-tuning a language model to\n",
    "understand and generate music. They encompass a wide range of moods,\n",
    "from the stormy drama of the \"Pathétique\" to the serene beauty of the\n",
    "\"Moonlight Sonata.\" Furthermore, they present varied structures and\n",
    "technical challenges, reflecting Beethoven's own journey as a composer\n",
    "and his responses to personal and societal changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples of notable sonatas**:\n",
    "1. **Piano Sonata No.8 in C minor, Op.13 \"Pathétique\"**: This sonata is\n",
    "   renowned for its emotional depth and dramatic contrasts.\n",
    "2. **Piano Sonata No.14 in C♯ minor \"Quasi una fantasia\", Op.27, No.2\n",
    "   \"Moonlight\"**: Known for its hauntingly beautiful first movement,\n",
    "   it's one of Beethoven's most recognized and played pieces.\n",
    "3. **Piano Sonata No.21 in C major, Op.53 \"Waldstein\"**: A testament to\n",
    "   Beethoven's innovative spirit, this sonata is celebrated for its\n",
    "   intricate rhythms and expansive form.\n",
    "4. **Piano Sonata No.23 in F minor, Op.57 \"Appassionata\"**: One of his\n",
    "   most powerful works, it's a reflection of Beethoven's mastery in\n",
    "   conveying deep emotions.\n",
    "5. **Piano Sonata No.29 in B♭ major, Op.106 \"Hammerklavier\"**: As one of\n",
    "   the longest and most challenging sonatas, it stands as a pinnacle in\n",
    "   the solo piano literature.\n",
    "\n",
    "These sonatas, among others, provide a rich tapestry of musical ideas,\n",
    "making them an ideal choice for the project at hand.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preparation**:\n",
    "   - MIDI files, a standard for representing musical information\n",
    "     digitally, are sourced for the project. Specifically, Beethoven's\n",
    "     piano sonatas are chosen given their rich musical structures and\n",
    "     historical significance.\n",
    "   - The `pretty_midi` library is employed to parse these MIDI files.\n",
    "     For each note in the MIDI files, its pitch and duration are\n",
    "     extracted to create a textual representation.\n",
    "   - These text representations are aggregated and structured, resulting\n",
    "     in a dataset suitable for training machine learning models.  <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "2. **Model Fine-tuning**:\n",
    "   - OpenAI's GPT3.5 Turbo, a pre-trained large language model, is\n",
    "     selected as the base model.  This model is then fine-tuned on the\n",
    "     dataset created in the previous step. The objective is to enable\n",
    "     the model to understand and replicate the musical patterns and\n",
    "     intricacies inherent in Beethoven's compositions.  <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "3. **Music Generation**:\n",
    "   - To generate new compositions, a detailed prompt is crafted and\n",
    "     provided to the fine-tuned model. The prompt instructs the model to\n",
    "     produce music in a text format, specifically using the\n",
    "     pitch-duration representation.\n",
    "   - The interaction with the model, including prompt engineering and\n",
    "     output retrieval, is managed using the `LangChain` library.\n",
    "   - The resultant series of notes, characterized by their pitch and\n",
    "   - duration, are inspired by the style of Beethoven's sonatas and\n",
    "   - serve as the foundation for the AI-generated composition.  <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "1. **Conversion to MIDI**:\n",
    "   - A conversion script is developed to transform the text\n",
    "     representation output from the model back into a MIDI format. This\n",
    "     involves a reverse engineering of the initial data preparation\n",
    "     step.\n",
    "   - The `midiutil` library is used to craft a new MIDI file based on\n",
    "the model's output.  <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "1. **Playback and Analysis**:\n",
    "   - The generated MIDI file is played back using the `mido` package in\n",
    "     combination with macOS GarageBand. This allows for an auditory\n",
    "     evaluation of the AI-generated music.\n",
    "   - The compositions can be analyzed for their adherence to Beethoven's\n",
    "     style, their musicality, and their novelty.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**: This methodology offers a novel approach to generating\n",
    "music inspired by classical compositions using AI. While the quality of\n",
    "the generated pieces is contingent on various factors, including the\n",
    "training data and the fine-tuning process, the approach provides a\n",
    "foundation for further exploration into AI-generated music.\n"
