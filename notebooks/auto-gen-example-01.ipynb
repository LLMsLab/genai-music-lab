    "Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Frequency Penalty helps us avoid using the same words too often. It’s like telling the computer, “Hey, don’t repeat words too much.”\n",
    "- Presence Penalty, on the other hand, encourages using different words. It’s like saying, “Hey, use a variety of words, not just the same ones.”\n",
    "- So, Frequency Penalty stops repetition, while Presence Penalty encourages variety. They work differently but help make the text more interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Frequency and Presence penalties are not sides of the same coin:\n",
    "\n",
    "These two expressions share a common underlying aim of reducing repetition and promoting variety in word usage. However, they emphasize different aspects and are not strictly logically equivalent.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **“Don’t repeat words too much”**:\n",
    "    - This expression directly addresses the issue of repetition. It instructs to avoid using the same words over and over, which is a straightforward directive against repetition.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **“Use a variety of words, not just the same ones”**:\n",
    "    - This expression goes a step further by not only discouraging repetition (implied by the phrase \"not just the same ones\") but also actively encouraging diversity in word choice (implied by the phrase \"use a variety of words\"). \n",
    "\n",
    "The difference can be highlighted in a scenario where one adheres to the instruction of not repeating words too much but still uses a very limited vocabulary. They would be following the first expression but not the second. On the other hand, someone who uses a variety of words is likely adhering to both expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a broader sense, the second expression encompasses the directive of the first but adds an additional directive to use a wider range of vocabulary. Hence, while they align in discouraging repetition, they diverge on the aspect of promoting diversity, making them not entirely equivalent."
