      "Human: I need assistance in producing AI-generated text that I convert to music using MIDI files. Initially, I'll provide a description of the format I need for the textual representation of the music.  Since music is a time-based art form, the notes follow each other in time, and sometimes there are no notes, that is, silences.  The way I would like you to generate them is as follows: Each note is represented as a tuple of two elements: The pitch of the note (integer value).  Because I will use this text representation and convert to MIDI the note should be a number from 21 (that is note A0 - 27,50 Hz) to 96 (that is C7 - 2093 hz) so use these numbers to represent the note.  The duration of the note (float value) represented as: 0.125 for an eighth note 0.25 for a quarter note 0.5 for a half note 1 for a whole note 2 for a double whole note But could be any number between 0 and 2, bocouse you know, musician are creative so why not 0.29 or 1.22, etc. With this format i need you generate a text that i will covert in music in this format: melody_pitch_duration_data = [ (note, duration), (note, duration), (note, duration), etc, ]\n",
      "And when there is a silence the note should be 0 and the duration is how long is that silence.  A melody is a linear sequence of notes that the listener hears as a single entity. It is the foreground to the backing elements and is a combination of pitch and rhythm. Sequences of notes that comprise melody are musically satisfying and are often the most memorable part of a song.  There are many ways to describe a melody. Here are a few:\n",
      "Pitch: The pitch of a melody is the relative highness or lowness of the notes. Melodies can be high, low, or somewhere in between.\n",
      "Rhythm: The rhythm of a melody is the pattern of long and short notes. Melodies can have a slow, steady rhythm, a fast, syncopated rhythm, or something in between.\n",
      "Intervals: Intervals are the distance between notes. Melodies can use a variety of intervals, from small steps to large leaps.  \n",
      "Contour: The contour of a melody is the overall shape of the melody. Melodies can be ascending, descending, or something in between.  \n",
      "Tonal center: The tonal center of a melody is the note that the melody feels like it is centered around. Melodies can have a strong tonal center, a weak tonal center, or no tonal center at all.  When describing a melody, it is important to consider all of these factors. The pitch, rhythm, intervals, contour, and tonal center all contribute to the overall sound of the melody.  Here are some examples of how to describe melodies: \n",
      "The melody of \"Happy Birthday\" is simple and repetitive, with a clear tonal center.\n",
      "The melody of \"Yesterday\" by The Beatles is more complex, with a variety of intervals and a changing tonal center.\n",
      "The melody of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" by Queen is highly dramatic, with a wide range of pitches and rhythms.  Quality melodies typically limit their range to about an octave-and-a-half, feature repeating elements like melodic intervals and rhythmic patterns, and consist of stepwise motion with occasional energetic leaps. Good melodies also interact meaningfully with the bass line, employing a mix of parallel, similar, oblique, or contrary motions for a dynamic, counter melodic effect. Finally, a standout melody tends to have a climactic moment, often a high note with significant harmonization and strong rhythmic placement, which then descends to a restful cadence.  No matter how it is described, a melody is one of the most important elements of music. It is what gives a song its identity and makes it memorable.\n",
