    "## An Introduction to Beethoven's Piano Sonatas\n",
    "\n",
    "Ludwig van Beethoven, a towering figure in the history of classical music, left an indelible mark on the world of piano composition. Among his vast oeuvre, the piano sonatas stand out as a testament to his genius, innovation, and expressiveness. Spanning his early, middle, and late periods, these works encapsulate the evolution of his style and the depth of his emotional expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beethoven's piano sonatas are not just a series of compositions; they are a journey through his life. From the early sonatas, which bear the influence of his predecessors like Mozart and Haydn, to the later ones, where he broke free from classical conventions and ventured into new territories of form and expression, each piece tells a story. They reflect his struggles, joys, introspections, and his relentless pursuit of artistic perfection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Path√©tique\" (Op. 13) with its dramatic contrasts, the \"Moonlight\" (Op. 27 No. 2) with its hauntingly beautiful Adagio, and the challenging \"Hammerklavier\" (Op. 106) are just a few examples that showcase the range and depth of Beethoven's creativity. Each sonata, whether it's the stormy \"Tempest\" (Op. 31 No. 2) or the radiant \"Waldstein\" (Op. 53), offers listeners a unique experience, a glimpse into Beethoven's soul.\n",
    "\n",
    "For pianists, these sonatas are both a challenge and a reward. They demand technical prowess, deep understanding, and emotional connectivity. For listeners, they offer a rich tapestry of melodies, themes, and emotions that resonate across time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this collection, we present all of Beethoven's piano sonatas, a musical journey that spans his entire career. Whether you're a seasoned aficionado or a new listener, these works are a testament to the enduring power and beauty of Beethoven's musical legacy."

    "a specified website.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setting Up the Environment**:\n",
    "    - The code begins by importing necessary libraries: `requests` for\n",
    "      downloading files from the web, `os` for directory and file\n",
    "      operations, and `zipfile` for handling ZIP files.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Defining URLs and Directories**:\n",
    "    - The base URL `https://www.suzumidi.com/midi/beethovn/` is where\n",
    "      the ZIP files are hosted.\n",
    "    - A list of filenames (`file_names`) is generated using a list\n",
    "      comprehension. This list contains filenames in the format\n",

    "      extracted contents of these ZIP files.\n",

    "    - The code checks if the directories `download_directory` and\n",
    "      `unzip_directory` exist. If they don't, the code creates them.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Downloading and Extracting Files**:\n",
    "    - For each filename in the `file_names` list:\n",
    "        - The full URL of the file is constructed by appending the\n",
    "          filename to the base URL.\n",

    "          The response is streamed to handle potentially large files\n",

    "        - If the download is successful (HTTP status code 200), the file\n",
    "          is saved to the `download_directory`.\n",
    "        - The saved ZIP file is then extracted using the\n",
    "          `zipfile.ZipFile` class, and its contents are saved to the\n",
